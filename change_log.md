- **Database:** Uses `marketpulse.db` in current directory

### **Dependency Strategy:**
- **Prophet:** Disabled due to NumPy 2.0 compatibility issues
- **ML Libraries:** Optional - system works with statistical fallbacks
- **Database:** SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production

### **Integration Pattern:**
- **Input:** Market data + signal features
- **Processing:** ML ensemble → PoP calculation
- **Output:** Trading signals with confidence scores
- **Tracking:** Complete trade lifecycle in database

## 🎯 **TOMORROW'S FOCUS**

### **ML Signal Enhancer Integration:**
1. Update method calls to use `predict_profitability()`
2. Fix configuration parameters (`confidence_boost`, etc.)
3. Test full integration flow
4. Validate enhanced trading system

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Complete ML integration working end-to-end
- All test suite passing
- Enhanced trading system operational
- Ready for real data integration

---

## 🏁 **SESSION CONCLUSION**

**MAJOR SUCCESS:** Advanced ML Alpha Model confirmed operational with production-grade architecture.

**Ready for:** ML Signal Enhancer integration completion and full system testing.

**Next Session:** Complete the integration layer and achieve full ML-enhanced trading system.
