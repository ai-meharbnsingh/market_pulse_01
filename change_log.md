1. **AlphaModelCore** (`03_ML_ENGINE/models/alpha_model.py`)
   - ‚úÖ CONFIRMED OPERATIONAL
   - Method: `predict_profitability(signal_features)` 
   - Output: PoP score + confidence level
   - Features: Database integration, ML ensemble with XGBoost/LightGBM fallbacks

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Created but dependency conflicts resolved (Prophet disabled)
   - Features: LSTM + Prophet integration, multi-timeframe predictions
   - Status: Architecture complete, import issues resolved

3. **MLSignalEnhancer** (`03_ML_ENGINE/models/ml_signal_enhancer.py`)
   - üîß Configuration fixes needed
   - Issue: Method name mismatch (expects `predict` vs actual `predict_profitability`)
   - Status: Ready for integration once method calls updated

### **Test Results:**
- **Minimal Test:** ‚úÖ PASSED - Core ML functionality confirmed
- **Alpha Model:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Generating PoP predictions 
- **Integration:** üîß Pending ML Signal Enhancer method alignment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING INTEGRATION TASKS**

### **Immediate Priority (Tomorrow's Session):**
1. **Fix ML Signal Enhancer:** Update method calls from `predict` to `predict_profitability`
2. **Complete Integration Testing:** All components working together  
3. **Enhanced Trading System:** Connect AlphaModelCore properly
4. **Method Signature Alignment:** Ensure consistent interfaces

### **Technical Fixes Needed:**
- ML Signal Enhancer configuration: Add missing parameters
- Method name consistency: Use `predict_profitability()` throughout
- Import path corrections: Handle class name differences
- Integration testing: Full end-to-end validation

---

## üí° **KEY DECISIONS & DISCOVERIES**

### **Advanced Model Architecture:**
- **Class:** `AlphaModelCore` (not `AlphaModel`)
- **Method:** `predict_profitability()` (not `predict()`)
- **Output:** `{'ensemble_pop': 0.5, 'confidence': 'LOW', 'method': 'ML'}`
- **Database:** Uses `marketpulse.db` in current directory

### **Dependency Strategy:**
- **Prophet:** Disabled due to NumPy 2.0 compatibility issues
- **ML Libraries:** Optional - system works with statistical fallbacks
- **Database:** SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production

### **Integration Pattern:**
- **Input:** Market data + signal features
- **Processing:** ML ensemble ‚Üí PoP calculation
- **Output:** Trading signals with confidence scores
- **Tracking:** Complete trade lifecycle in database

## üéØ **TOMORROW'S FOCUS**

### **ML Signal Enhancer Integration:**
1. Update method calls to use `predict_profitability()`
2. Fix configuration parameters (`confidence_boost`, etc.)
3. Test full integration flow
4. Validate enhanced trading system

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Complete ML integration working end-to-end
- All test suite passing
- Enhanced trading system operational
- Ready for real data integration
